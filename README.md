# Simple-Photo-editor
I wrote image editing and manipulation software for pam and BMP formats. This software contains over 20 basic arithmetic operations for image editing. Also, the user can create his own composite operation using these basic. The photo editor supports work with many layers as well as selections. The software has an option to save the project in custom XML format.
